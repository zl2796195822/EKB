# Feature Flags

Feature flags let you opt into experimental tool behavior on top of the default
GitHub MCP Server surface. Insiders Mode turns on a curated subset of these
flags automatically — see [Insiders Features](./insiders-features.md) for that
specific set.

For background on how flags resolve at request time, see the [resolution
section in the Insiders docs](./insiders-features.md#how-feature-flags-are-resolved).

## Enabling a flag

| Method | Remote Server | Local Server |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Header | `X-MCP-Features: <flag>,<flag>` | N/A |
| CLI flag | N/A | `--features=<flag>,<flag>` |
| Environment variable | N/A | `GITHUB_FEATURES=<flag>,<flag>` |

Only flags listed in
[`AllowedFeatureFlags`](../pkg/github/feature_flags.go) can be enabled by
end users. Insiders-only flags are not user-toggleable.

---

## Tools affected by each flag

The list below is regenerated from the Go source. For each user-controllable
feature flag, it lists every tool whose **inventory or input schema** differs
from the default — either because the flag introduces a new tool, or because
it selects a flag-aware variant of an existing tool. Flags that only affect
runtime behavior (such as output formatting) won't appear here.
